# Spigot-Coding-Tutorial

This is a complete repository of all the source code show in my Spigot Plugin Tutorial. If you have not seen my series then [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJyTEuqLQfU&list=PLDhiRTZ_vnoUvdrkTnaWP_hPmbj2JfPAF). 
The series attempts to cover the entire Bukkit/Spigot API, starting with beginner concepts and moving all the way to feature-packed, advanced plugins!
